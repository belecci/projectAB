                <h3>
      This project is based on a Tic Tac Toe game made by me.</h3>
      <p> Tic Tac Toe is normally played by 2 players, </p>
        <p>and one player is "X" and second one is "O"</p>
      <p>and they keep puting their signs in a box that has in 9 quadrants, </p>
        <p>and which player faster fills up a line from the box, Wins.</p>

    <h4>
      The game that i made represents a computer version of the actual game that
      you can play with the 2nd player. 
      <p>And i coded the programme to introduce the name of the "1 player" and "2 player" that you can see in the screenshot below.

    <h4>
      I introduced a "Scoreboard" that writes all the game's results from that
      moment when you open the game and keeps introducing the results up to that
      moment when you close the game.

          <h4> After that on the screen you can see that to the "1 player" is giving a choice between: </h4>
            <p> "X" by typing "1" </p> 
            <p> Or "O" by typing "2" </p>
            <p> Or either to close the game by typing on "3" on the keyboard.  </p>

                <h2>-[II]-[Sample Run]</h2>
    <h4>
      When you start the game the "1 player" gets the choice first where he wants to put either "X" or "O", depends on what did he choose.
    </h4>  
    <h3>And the game starts!<h3>
  
    <h5>________________________________________________________<h5>
    
        <img src="start.JPG" alt="jpg" width="200" height="200" />
        
<h4>Let's say the "1 player" has choosen the top left box so he types number "1" on the keyboard and the sign that he had choosen appears in that box.</h4> 
    

    
    <img src="part2.JPG" alt="jpg" width="200" height="200" /> 
    <h4>So now we can see that the sign "X" is in the box, and the game is waiting for the "2 player" to choose the box.
    </h4>
    <h4>And the game is keep going like that, until one of the players wins.</h4>

          <p>How you can see </p>
          <p>on the "scoreboard"</p> 
          <p>the score now is 1:0</p> 
          <p>for the "1 player"</p>
          <p>becuase he won the last game.</p>

            <h2>[Planning]</h2>
            <p>At the start in my mind I had 2 ideas of the games that I should make, first it was the "Tic Tac Toe" game and the second game was the "Nokia-Snake".</p>
            <p>The "Nokia-Snake" game I already had made before but it had a very simple code and it wasn't very developed.</p>
            <p>And I decided to make levels in the game to have a bit more code and a bit harder, and I spent like a day to make but something wasn't going good and the levels were the same hard. </p>
            <p>After that I decided for every level to add obstacles and more "apples" but still something didn't work and were the same obstacles for every level and wasn't that good the game.</p>
            <p>The "Tic Tac Toe" I had it already but the code wasn't finished so I just decided to continue the code and the project to make based on the "Tic Tac Toe".</p>
            <p>And the idea how the project should look I took from a sample project that our teacher presented to us.</p>
            <p>Before the game presented two options for the first player, to choose between "X" or "O", and to quit the game you could just by closing the whole program so I decided to introduce the option to quit the game as well.</p>
            <p>And before the "scoreboard" was just a box so I decided to change it as well, and I researched for a new looking "scoreboard" and I liked this one more, that is now in the programm. And the thing is that is nothing special but it looks better.</p>
            <p>After this changes I presented the game to the teacher and she said that "It's very good", so like that I decided to do the project based on "Tic Tac Toe" game. That now it's presented to you. </p>
            <p>The game had to achieve the next objectives:</p>
            <p>Work Proper</p>
            <p>Have the possibility to play with someone</p>
            <p>Don't have any laggs</p>
            <p>Play with the AI of the game</p>
            
            <h2>-[III]-[The Coding Part]</h2>
<h4>The game was made in the program <u>PyCharm</u>.</h4>

<h3>What is PyCharm?</h3>
<p>Developed by JetBrains in 2010, PyCharm is an IDE used for computer programming.</p>
<p>Though this IDE was created for Python primarily.</p>
<p>And it's good also, becuase  it provides code analysis, integration with VCSes <b>(Version Control Systems)</b>.</p>

            <h5>__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</h5>
<p>In this flowchart made by me, i introduced every step of the programm and now i'm going to explain them.</p>
<p>When you start the game, the programm asks the players names and when the names are introduced the first player gets the choice between "X" or "O" or either to quit the game.</p>
<p>And the game starts with the first player move.</p>
<p>After the first player's move the programm checks for win, if its not the game continues, if its yes the game stops the answers go in the scoreboard and first player gets the choice again of "X" or "O" or to quit the game.</p>
<p>But if the win is not presnt the game continues and second player gets the move.</p> 
<p>After second player's move the game checks again for the win if he won answers go in the scoreboard first player gets the choice of "X" or "O" or to quit the game.  </p>
<p>You can ask me:</p> 
<h3>What happends if one of the players fills the space that was already filled?</h3>       
<p>Here is the answer:</p>

      <h2>[Evaluation]</h2>
          <p>How I said in the [Planning] section the initial programm was a bit different than the final product, because I changed the interface of the scoreboard and I added the choice of quiting the game.</p>
          <p>The game achieved nearly all my objectives and the single one that I couldn't manage is "playing with the AI".</p>
          <p>Playing with the AI of the game for me was a bit hard to introduce because the code wasn't good and was lagging and I just excluded this from the game and to make it a bit yeasier and more accesible.</p>
          <p>For the future to develop this game I could introduce the method of playing with the AI of the game after getting some more experience I think this won't be a problem for the future.</p>
          <p>Second thing that a could add will be the memoring of the game of the games after you quit the game and get in again and there to get options of continuing the last games or to start a new one with a different player.</p>
          <p>This one is going to be harder to make it in real but with the experience I should manage that and defenetly to add in.</p>

         <a href = "https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter10.html"> Sample Project</a>
         <p>This project was one of the references that I used to make my project, I got some ideas how my project should look and be arranged.</p>
         <p>And I got this as my refernces because is a project based on the same game as I made so it was a good model for mine.</p>
